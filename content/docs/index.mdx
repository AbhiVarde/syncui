#### Introduction

Sync UI empowers you to efficiently design modern and interactive React applications. This toolkit provides a rich library of pre-built, customizable components, allowing you to focus on crafting exceptional user experiences.

To use Sync UI, you need to set up a React or Next.js project and install MUI and Framer Motion. Follow the instructions below to get started.

#### Setting up your project

First, you'll need to set up a React.js or Next.js project. Choose the option that best fits your needs:

##### Option 1: Create a new React.js project

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

**Learn more about React:** [https://reactjs.org/](https://reactjs.org/)

```bash
npx create-react-app my-sync-ui-app
cd my-sync-ui-app
```

To start your React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

##### Option 2: Create a new Next.js project

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

**Explore Next.js:** [https://nextjs.org/](https://nextjs.org/)

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-sync-ui-app
cd my-sync-ui-app
```

To start your Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### What is MUI?

MUI (Material UI) is a React UI framework offering a robust set of customizable components. This library simplifies the creation of consistent, accessible, and responsive interfaces.
