title: The Story of Sync UI
description: A 1-year journey of Sync UI, the animated MUI component library
---

#### Hey there! 👋

I'm **Abhi**, the creator of **Sync UI**.  
This is the story of how Sync UI started, grew, and evolved over 1 year.

---

#### How It All Started 🚀

During Navratri 2024, I realized there weren't any **animated MUI component libraries** like the Tailwind + Framer Motion ones out there.  
So I decided to build **Sync UI**-a library where components stay in sync with design, motion, and developer experience.

I started small, building components one by one, taking inspiration from Tailwind + Framer Motion libraries but implementing everything in **MUI + Framer Motion**.  
Each component gradually gained its own **unique touches** to fit Sync UI's style and layout.

---

#### The Early Components 🐣

By the first month, I had built:

- 10 core components  
-3-4 variations each  
- Around 30-40 ready-to-use components

This was the foundation for Sync UI, giving developers a **plug-and-play library** of animated components they could use instantly.

---

#### Naming & Launch 🎭

After brainstorming, I chose **Sync UI**-reflecting the idea that **everything stays in sync: design, motion, and developer experience.**

The first release coincided with **Navratri 2024**, and the response from friends and fellow developers was amazing!

---

#### Growing Month by Month 🌱

I promised myself: **add something new every month.**

And I kept that promise:

- Added new components regularly  
- Introduced templates for portfolios, SaaS, and startups  
- Maintained a **monthly changelog** so users could see the progress

All components remain **free**, while templates are offered at a **very affordable price ($29 each)**.

---

#### Achievements & Stats ✨

After 1 year, Sync UI has:

- **70+ free animated components**  
- **3 ready-made templates**  
- Searchable component library for easy browsing  
- Appwrite + Resend integration for newsletters  
- **75+ GitHub stars** from developers worldwide  
- **8K+ views, 2K+ visitors, 80+ countries** 🌍

These numbers show that Sync UI is **reaching developers globally** and making an impact in the community.

---

#### Looking Ahead 🔮

The journey continues. The goals for the next year include:

- Adding more components and templates  
- Continuing to improve developer experience  
- Helping more developers build **beautiful, animated UIs quickly**  
- Hopefully getting **more stars, some template sales 💸, and new opportunities**  

The focus remains on **building quality tools** while exploring opportunities to collaborate with teams that appreciate innovation.

#### Closing Thoughts ❤️

Sync UI is the result of a **year of consistent building, learning, and creating**.

It's exciting to see it grow and be useful for developers everywhere, and I can't wait to see what the next year brings!
