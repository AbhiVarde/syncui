  pnpm="pnpm create react-app my-app"
  bun="bun create react-app my-app"
/>

Navigate to your project:

```bash
cd my-app
```

#### Install dependencies

Add React Router and the required packages for Sync UI:

<PackageManagerTabs

  yarn="yarn add react-router-dom @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled motion react-icons"
  pnpm="pnpm add react-router-dom @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled motion react-icons"
  bun="bun add react-router-dom @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled motion react-icons"
/>

#### Start development

<PackageManagerTabs
  npm="npm start"
