description: Add Sync UI to any existing React project.
---

#### Prerequisites

You'll need an existing React project with a package manager installed (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun).

#### Install dependencies

Add the required packages for Sync UI to your project:

<PackageManagerTabs
  npm="npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled motion react-icons"
  yarn="yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled motion react-icons"
  pnpm="pnpm add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled motion react-icons"
  bun="bun add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled motion react-icons"
/>

#### Start development

Run your development server (the command depends on your project setup):

<PackageManagerTabs
  npm="npm start"
  yarn="yarn start"
  pnpm="pnpm start"
  bun="bun start"
/>

Or if using Vite or a custom setup:

<PackageManagerTabs
  npm="npm run dev"
  yarn="yarn dev"
  pnpm="pnpm dev"
  bun="bun dev"
/>

#### You're all set!

Browse our library and start building:

→ Check out [Components](/components) – Copy-paste ready UI elements

→ Explore [Blocks](/blocks) – Pre-built page sections

→ Customize freely – All code is yours to modify

Simply copy any component code and paste it into your project. No additional setup needed!
